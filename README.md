insulting
=========

insult.ahk is a script for AutoHotkey app from www.autohotkey.com for Windows.

Based heavily on a user submitted scripted called RaNVingNVer taken from their forums, it takes the contents of the 3 files Noun.txt, Verber.txt and Verber.txt and return a random insult when 'insult' is typed.

The three files were populated with Shakespearian insults borrowed from http://www.pangloss.com/seidel/shake_rule.html (shakespear.txt)
Additonal insults were added for use with Elite: Dangerous user comms. http://www.elitedangerous.com
